# Automatic-Tic-Detection
#This Python-based tool steps forward to automatic detection of hyperkinetic behavior in a Tourette syndrome rat model.
#After evaluating the coordinates tracked by SLEAP, this tool analyzes the body parts tracked at speed and the displacement
#of body points along specific body axes to identify a tic.
