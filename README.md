# Automatic-Tic-Detection
This Python-based tool steps forward to automatic detection of hyperkinetic behavior in a Tourette syndrome rat model.
After evaluating the coordinates tracked by SLEAP (Pereira et al., 2022), this tool analyzes the body parts tracked at velocity (Pereira et al., 2022) and the displacement
of body points along specific body axes to identify a tic.
Input files are manually evaluated csv files, a hp5 file generated by SLEAP, and optionally a video file for rough evaluation of motion matching to automatic/manual scoring.
